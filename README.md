# Coffee Shop Website

A single-page website for a fictional coffee shop, featuring a responsive design with a navigation menu, hero section, menu, gallery, contact form, order system, and footer. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with code organized into separate files for better maintainability: `CoffeeWeb.html` (structure), `CoffeeWeb.css` (styling), and `CoffeeWeb.js` (interactivity).

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation**: Fixed navbar with smooth scrolling and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu.
- **Hero Section**: Welcoming section with calls-to-action for ordering and contacting.
- **About Section**: Information about coffee culture with social media links.
- **Menu Section**: Displays coffee and tea items with descriptions and images.
- **Gallery Section**: Image gallery with hover zoom effects.
- **Contact Section**: Contact details and a static form for user inquiries.
- **Order System**: Interactive section to select items, view quantities, and calculate the total price.
- **Footer**: Includes copyright, social media links, and policy links.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Defines the websiteâ€™s structure.
- **CSS3**: Provides styling with CSS variables, Flexbox, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Enables mobile menu toggling and order system functionality.
- **Font Awesome**: Supplies icons for social media and contact information.
- **Google Fonts**: Enhances typography with custom fonts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- No additional software is required, as the project runs in the browser.
## Usage

- **Navigation**: Use the navbar to jump to sections (Home, About, Menu, Gallery, Contact).
- **Mobile Menu**: On smaller screens, click the hamburger icon to toggle the menu.
- **Order System**: In the Order section, click item buttons (e.g., Coffee, Black Coffee) to add to your order. The total price and item quantities update dynamically.
- **Contact Form**: Fill out the form to simulate sending a message (note: the form is static and requires a backend for functionality).
